# IMDb_Movie_Industry
My Capstone Project From Caltech Analytic Program
This project provides some insights about movie industry for normal people or even some entry level actors to get to known the work environment (e.g. who's best director to co-work, which area produce high rating movies?)
For the files, Part 1 is for EDA and data cleaning, Part 2 is for ML.
For data viz, I export several csv files and apply them on Tableau.
Here's the viz final result, feel free to poke around the dashboard:
