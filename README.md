My Capstone Project From Caltech Analytic Program

This project provides some insights about movie industry for normal people or even some entry level actors to get to known the work environment (e.g. who's best director to co-work, which area produce high rating movies?)

For the files, Part 1 is for EDA and data cleaning, Part 2 is for ML.

For data viz, I export several csv files and apply them on Tableau.


Finding:

1)Since 1900's, the total movies amount with completed recored infomation is 778,794

2)The most productive director is Jing Wong

3)The most common language of movies is English

4)Average Age of actor getting famous is older than actress

5)The movie industry has age preference toward both genders. (Industry prefers older actor and younger actress)

6)The ML part: Decision Tree and Ensemble perform the best for prediction of movie rating

Here's the viz final result, feel free to poke around the dashboard:
